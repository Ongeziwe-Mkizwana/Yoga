    <h1>Electricity</h1>
    <p class="p1">
      Electricity is a natural phenomenon that occurs throughout nature and
      takes many different forms. In this tutorial we'll focus on current
      electricity: the stuff that powers our electronic gadgets. Our goal is to
      understand how electricity flows from a power source through wires,
      lighting up LEDs, spinning motors, and powering our communication devices.

    <p class="p2">
      Electricity is briefly defined as the flow of electric charge, but there's
      so much behind that simple statement. Where do the charges come from? How
      do we move them? Where do they move to? How does an electric charge cause
      mechanical motion or make things light up? So many questions! To begin to
      explain what electricity is we need to zoom way in, beyond the matter and
      molecules, to the atoms that make up everything we interact with in life.
